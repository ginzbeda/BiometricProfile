Startup app for managing user stress. The full application uses, user device sensors to collect biometric reading and predict a user's stress and anxiety level. This part of the application focused on using the Spotify api to create playlists and generate a token for user input. The full application then uses these playlists to generate mood stability in users experiencing anxiety.
